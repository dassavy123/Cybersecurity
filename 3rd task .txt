Vulnerability: Ruby Rack library < 2.2.14, < 3.0.16, or < 3.1.14 is affected.

Impact: An attacker can send crafted HTTP requests that exhaust memory or CPU, stalling or crashing the Rack server (denial of service).

Your host: Nessus shows Rack 2.2.11 is installed at

/usr/share/metasploit-framework/vendor/bundle/ruby/3.3.0/gems/rack-2.2.11


fix: Upgrade to Rack ≥ 2.2.14, ≥ 3.0.16, or ≥ 3.1.14.

Update Rack gem

# update Rack to safe version
gem install rack -v 2.2.14

# or for latest in 2.x branch
gem install rack --version "~> 2.2.14"

# verify version
gem list rack


For Metasploit (your screenshot path shows Rack inside Metasploit’s vendor bundle)

Metasploit bundles its own gems. To fix:

cd /usr/share/metasploit-framework
bundle update rack

Temporary mitigations (if you cannot patch immediately)

Restrict external access to apps using Rack (firewall rules, reverse proxy).

Put the app behind a WAF (modsecurity, nginx with rate-limiting).

Monitor CPU/memory spikes for Rack processes.
